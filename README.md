# Johnson's LotJPlugins

## Overview

This is a repository of plugins that I use with LotJ in an attempt to make certain 
 aspects of the game less tedious, easier to see visually, or to provide an 
 overall greater playing experience. These aren't intended to circumnavigate
 rules or allow cheating or exploiting in any fashion. Some of these plugins 
 are written entirely by me, some have been inspired by plugins on other MUDs 
 and some were created by other members of the LotJ community. I try to give 
 credit in each respective plugin where it is due, but if you see something 
 posted here that you had any part in helping create that hasn't been attributed 
 to you, I humbly apologize and ask that you inform me ASAP so I can remedy my 
 mistake.
  
These plugins are largely a work in progress and as a result often see many,
 many changes and differing versions. If something isn't working properly,
 first check to see if you have the most recent version, and if something still
 doesn't seem right, congratulations, you may have found a bug! Please let me
 know about it so I can fix it!
  
Questions, comments, complaints, suggestions, bug reports can be directed 
 via email to __LotJJohnson@gmail.com__, in game __@Johnson__, in the issues section
 of the GitHub repository, or on the LotJ forums.

## ChangeLog

### LotJRecord.xml

#### v1.00
* Released early version of this plugin. It allows you to record and replay game events while preserving time scale and original coloring, giving you exactly the experience of the situation recorded.
* As mentioned this is an early release so there aren't a lot of features, mainly the core mechanic of recording and replaying.
* More features may be added if there is interest in that happening.

### LotJRaceBrowser.xml

#### v1.00
* Released first version of this plugin. It loads race information from the game and displays it in a window to make browsing and comparing races more convenient.
* Right click in the window to apply sorting filters.

### LotJMSDPHandler.xml

#### v0.55
* Reworked from the ground up how MSDP variables are parsed from the mud to store lists and arrays correctly.
* If you retrieve a variable in list or array form, it will be returned in a comma-separated list of key,value pairs.
 
#### v0.52
* Added LotJMSDPHelper.lua script file to hopefully ease usage of MSDP variables in community plugins.
    * To use MSDP variables in your plugin add the following code:
```
dofile(GetPluginInfo(GetPluginID(), 20) .. "LotJMSDPHelper.lua")
myVariable = getmsdp("VARIABLE NAME")
```

### LotJVisualSpace.xml

```
