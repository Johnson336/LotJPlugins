                        Johnson's LotJPlugins
               ===========================================
    Overview:
  This is a repository of plugins that I use with LotJ in an attempt to make certain 
 aspects of the game less tedious, easier to see visually, or to provide an 
 overall greater playing experience. These aren't intended to circumnavigate
 rules or allow cheating or exploiting in any fashion. Some of these plugins 
 are written entirely by me, some have been inspired by plugins on other MUDs 
 and some were created by other members of the LotJ community. I try to give 
 credit in each respective plugin where it is due, but if you see something 
 posted here that you had any part in helping create that hasn't been attributed 
 to you, I humbly apologize and ask that you inform me ASAP so I can remedy my 
 mistake.
  These plugins are largely a work in progress and as a result often see many,
 many changes and differing versions. If something isn't working properly,
 first check to see if you have the most recent version, and if something still
 doesn't seem right, congratulations, you may have found a bug! Please let me
 know about it so I can fix it!
  Questions, comments, complaints, suggestions, bug reports can be directed 
 via email to LotJJohnson@gmail.com, in game @Johnson, in the issues section
 of the GitHub repository, or on the LotJ forums.

    Installation (GitHub):
      https://github.com/Johnson336/LotJPlugins
    
   1. In the top right of the "<>Code" tab, click the "Clone or download" button,
      followed by "Download ZIP" button to download the entire directory as a zip file.
   2. Alternatively, click whichever plugin you wish to use and copy/paste the 
      code into a text editor, saving each .xml file individually.
      
   --WARNING-- Do NOT right click files and choose "Save link as" as this will
     attempt to save the entire web page and will result in a distorted .xml
     file and will throw errors if you try to install it! You have been warned!
