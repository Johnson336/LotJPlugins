                        Johnson's LotJPlugins
               ===========================================
    Overview:
  I offer these plugins to the LotJ community in an attempt to make certain
 aspects of the game less tedious, easier to see visually, or to provide an 
 overall greater playing experience. I do not provide these as a means with 
 which to cheat or exploit in any fashion. Some of these plugins are written 
 entirely by me, some have been inspired by plugins on other MUDs and some 
 were created by other members of the LotJ community. I try to give credit in 
 each respective plugin where it is due, though I am by no means perfect and 
 if you see something posted here that you had any part in helping create that
 hasn't been attributed to you, I humbly apologize and ask that you inform me 
 ASAP so I can remedy my mistake.
  These plugins are largely a work in progress and as a result often see many,
 many changes and differing versions. If something isn't working properly,
 first check to see if you have the most recent version, and if something still
 doesn't seem right, congratulations, you may have found a bug! Please let me
 know about it so I can fix it!
  Questions, comments, complaints, suggestions, bug reports can be directed 
 via email to lotjJohnson@gmail.com, in game @Johnson, in the issues section
 of the GitHub repository, or on the LotJ forums.

    Installation (GitHub):
      https://github.com/Johnson336/LotJPlugins
    
   1. In the top right of the "<>Code" tab, click the "Clone or download" button,
      followed by "Download ZIP" button to download the entire directory as a zip file.
   2. Alternatively, click whichever plugin you wish to use and copy/paste the 
      code into a text editor, saving each .xml file individually.
      
   --WARNING-- Do NOT right click files and choose "Save link as" as this will
     attempt to save the entire web page and will result in a distorted .xml
     file and will throw errors if you try to install it! You have been warned!
